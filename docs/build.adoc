== Building

The Ensono Stacks CLI can be built locally on a development workstation or in a CI/CD pipeline. It has been configured to use Azure DevOps, but can easily be configured to work with other CI/CD runners, such as GitLab CI and GitHub Actions.

The chapter illustrates how to get a development environment up and running and also how the CI/CD is configured.

=== Local Development

NOTE: Due to the use of a task runner, it is not necessary to install Go as a component on your local machine, as the runner will run the build within a Docker container. The only pre-requisite is that Eirctl is installed.

==== Install Eirctl

https://github.com/ensono/eirctl[Eirctl] is being used as in independent runner to build and test the code as well as generate this documentation. This means that whatever CI/CD runner is being used only needs to bootstrap the environment to run Eirctl.

Regardless of whether the CLI is being built on a local machine or in a build agent Eirctl needs to be installed.

Unblock-File -Path ~/bin/eirctl.exe

# Add the bin folder to the path
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $env:Path + ";c:/Users/{example_username}/bin")
----
|===

NOTE: All of the binaries that are built for Eirctl have AMD64 and ARM64 variants

In the case of the Azure DevOps build file, Eirctl is being downloaded directly from the release page of the project. This is so that we can control the version that is downloaded.

==== Clone the `stacks-cli` repository

Clone the repository to a location on disk, for example `C:\users\russell\workspaces\stacks\stacks-cli`.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p ~/workspaces/stacks
cd ~/workspaces/stacks
git clone git@github.com:Ensono/stacks-cli.git
----

==== Build the CLI

Building the Ensono Stacks CLI is as simple as running the default tasks using Eirctl. The default task is set to perform the following operations:

. Execute Tests
.. Run tests
.. Generate reports
. Compile
.. Create binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac OS

As this is the default task list, performing all tests and compiling the code is as simple as running one command in the stacks-cli repo directory.

[source,bash]
----
Eirctl build
----

The output of the command will be similar to the following.

==== Release

There is a task that performs as GitHub release and uploads the documentation and binaries that have been created.

The release is performed by a PowerShell function in the module, which uses the GitHub API to do the release. By doing it like this Eirctl performs the execution of the script, so it is not done by a propriatry task in the CI/CD build pipeline.

Actioning the release is done by running the command `task release`

All of the necessary parameters can be set using environment variables, which are detailed in the following table.

.Release script parameters
[options="header"]
|===
| Parameter | Environment Variable | Description | Example Value
| version | VERSION_NUMBER | Version number to be assigned to the release | `0.0.69`
| commitid | COMMIT_ID | The SHA commit id to be used to set up the release | `0E42486F2`
| notes | NOTES | Any notes that should be displayed on the release page |
`This is the latest release of the code`
| artifactsDir | ARTIFACTS_DIR | Directory that the artifacts to be added as assets to the release are in | `outputs`
| artifactsList | | List of files that need to be uploaded

If this is not specified then all of the files in the `artifactsDir` will be uploaded | `docs.pdf`
| owner | OWNER | Name of the owner of the repository | `ensono`
| apiKey | API_KEY | Personal access token to be used to perform the release | `ghp_L9VNP06qbasd87adlTDtslQvJCFH30cig4ace2A`
| repository | REPOSITORY | Name of the repository on which to create the release | `stacks-cli`
| draft | DRAFT | Specify if a draft release should be created. Default: `false` | `true`
| prerelease | PRERELEASE | Specify if a prerelease should be created. Default: `true` | `true`
|===

The main build pipeline file has a stage called Release, which downloads the necessary artifacts and then calls the `release` task on Eirctl to perform the release.

==== Build Documentation

All of the documentation for the CLI is kept in the `docs/` directory of the repository. It is all written in https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[Asciidoc] which is a much more comprehensive definition for writing documentation to Markdown.

Markdown is great for quick documentation, however by using Asciidoc it is possible to easily generate a PDF document, such as this document. There is a lot that can be done with Asciidoc, such as cross-referencing code listings and images and adding captions to the same.

It can also be used to generate Markdown files that are more easily added to static website generators, although Hugo has basic support for Asciidoc.

The Eirctl has setup with three tasks for the documentation:

. Download the Docker image for creating the documentation
. Create the PDF document
. Create the Markdown version of the files

This is run by using the command `Eirctl docs`.

===== Markdown Generation

Generating the Markdown files is a two step process, the first step is to use `asciidoctor` to generate a https://docbook.org/[Docbook] file, which is an XML definition of the document. It then uses https://pandoc.org/[Pandoc] to turn the XML into a Markdown file.

All of these steps are performed by the PowerShell script, `build/scripts/ConvertTo-Markdown.ps1`, which is shown below:

.Convert Asciidoc to Markdown
[source,powershell]
[[convert_adoc_to_md_script,{listing-caption} {counter:refnum}]]
....
include::../build/scripts/ConvertTo-Markdown.ps1[]
....

This script iterates around the `.adoc` files in the `docs/` directory and performs the conversion to XML and then MD on each one. The intended method of execution of the script is within the `{docs_build_docker_image}` Docker image. The image contains `pandoc`, `asciidoctor`, and `powershell`. The following shows and example of the Docker command executed by Eirctl.

.Executing PowerShell script for Markdown creation
[[convert_adoc_to_md_docker,{listing-caption} {counter:refnum}]]
[source,bash]
----
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app amidostacks/runner-pwsh-asciidoc:0.4.60-stable pwsh -command /eirctl/build/scripts/ConvertTo-Markdown.ps1 -docs_dir /eirctl/docs/ -output_dir /eirctl/outputs/docs/md
----

All of the markdown files are then uploaded as artefacts as part of the build.

=== Build Pipeline

A build pipeline file exists in `./build` that controls how the CLI is compiled in Azure DevOps.

The build consists of the following files:

.Build files
[options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description

| `azuredevops-Eirctl.yml` | Main pipeline file that AzDo uses to run the build
| `azuredevops-vars.yml` | Variable template file containing variables for the build
|===

==== Build Pipeline File

The build pipeline for Azure DevOps, `build/azuredevops-Eirctl.yml`, has been configured to bootstrap the environment for Eirctl to run. These steps are as follows:

. Install Eirctl
. Test and Compile
.. Configure GOBIN and PATH environment variables
.. Run build task of Eirctl
. Upload Test results
. Upload Coverage reports
. Upload manual
. Run integration tests by running the `inttest` task of the Eirctl
. For releases, run release task of Eirctl

All of the testing, compilation and documentation has been handled by Eirctl, the parts outside of this are to install Go and Eirctl and to upload build artefacts.

All of the compiled binaries, test reports and documentation are copied up to the artefact directory in Azure DevOps.
