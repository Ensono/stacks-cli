== Examples

This section provides some examples on how to run the CLI to setup a project from the Ensono Stacks projects.

NOTE: It is assumed that the Ensono Stacks CLI command has been installed and is in the path to be called using the `stacks-cli` name.

The following table shows the settings that are being used in each of the examples.

.Example settings
[options="header"]
|===
| Name | Value | Description
| company | `{example_company}` | Name of the company that the project is being created for
| area | `{example_area}` | The area within the company that the project is relevant to.

In previous versions of the CLI, this has been referred to as the domain, but it has been changed to area to avoid confusion with DNS domain.
| component | `{example_component}` | Component that the project is for
| domain | `{example_domain}` | DNS domain for which the application will respond to
| cloud | `{example_cloud}` | The cloud platform being used
| region | `{example_region}` | Region in the cloud that the resources will be deployed to
| group | `{example_group}` | Group that holds all of the cloud resources
| tfgroup | `{example_tf_group}` | Group that has the resources to be used to hold the Terraform state
| tfstorage | `{example_tf_storage}` | Name of the storage that will hold the Terraform state
| tfcontainer | `{example_tf_container}` | Container in the storage for the state files
| name | `{example_project_name}` | Name of the project to create in the working directory
| framework_option | `{example_framework_option}` | The option within the framework being created.

For `dotnet` or `java` the options are `webapi`, `cqrs` or `events`.
For `infra` the options are `aks`.

=== .NET

The following table shows the additional options that are required when scaffolding the .NET examples.

..NET Specific settings
[options="header"]

| Name | Value | Description
| framework | `{example_dotnet_framework}` | Framework being used, e.g. `dotnet`, `java`, `nx` or `infra`
| framework_version | `{example_dotnet_framework_version}` | Version of the framework option to grab.

=== Running scaffold command again

Due to the fact that the CLI does quite a lot of work, it will not attempt to create the projects if the project path already exists. For example, running the same command as before, without changing any of the settings will result in an error being displayed during the creation of the project.

[source,bash]
----
stacks-cli scaffold -c ./stacks.yml
----

.Project protection guard
image::images/stackscli-scaffold-project-guard.png[]

As can be seen the CLI will not overwrite anything at the same target path.

It is possible to change this behaviour, by adding the `--force` option to the command line. This will remove any existing directory and recreate the project in its place.

[source,bash]
----
stacks-cli scaffold -c ./stacks.yml --force
----

=== Checking Framework command versions

Each project that gets scaffolded by the CLI, has has `stackscli.yml` file which informs the CLI what to do for that project. One of the things that can be set is constraints on the version of the framework that needs to be installed.

For example take the following project settings file.

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
framework:
  name: dotnet
  commands:
    - name: dotnet
      version: ">= 3.1, < 3.2"


# Pipeline files
pipeline:
  - type: azdo
    files:
      - name: build
        path: build/azDevOps/azure/azure-pipelines-netcore-k8s.yml
      - name: variable
        path: build/azDevOps/azure/azuredevops-vars.yml
    replacements:
      - pattern: ^.*stacks-credentials-nonprod-kv$
        value: ""

# The init stage are things that are required to run before the template is run
init:
  operations:
    - action: cmd
      cmd: dotnet
      args: new -i .
      desc: Install "stacks-webapi" template from the repo directory
    - action: cmd
      cmd: dotnet
      args: new stacks-webapi -n {{ .Input.Business.Company }}.{{ .Input.Business.Domain }} -o {{ .Project.Directory.WorkingDir }}
      desc: Create a project using the "stacks-webapi" template
----

When the CLI runs it will take take the version constraint, on line 5, and compare the version of `dotnet` it finds with this constraint. The following screenshot shows this in action on a machine that has .NET version `5.0.303` installed.

.Dotnet command version check
image::images/stacks-scaffold-command-version-check.png[]

It is possible to bypass this version check by using the `--force` option on the command line, but note this is a destructive operation and if the project exists at the same location as the CLI is trying to write to the original project will be deleted.

In this case the error will still be displayed, but a a warning will state that the process is continuing.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There are two different version checks that are performed by the Ensono Stacks CLI when using a .NET project.

If a `global.json` file is present in the the project, it provides and absolute version of .NET that is required. It _is_ possible to force the setup of a project but the results may vary, as shown in <<Dotnet command version check>>.

If the `global.json` file does not exist, but a version constraint exists in the project settings, this will be evaluated and a similar message will be shown as before.
