== Examples

This section provides some examples on how to run the CLI to setup a project from the Ensono Digital Stacks projects.

NOTE: It is assumed that the Stacks CLI command has been installed and is in the path to be called using the `stacks-cli` name.

The following table shows the settings that are being used in each of the examples.

| company | `{example_company}` | Name of the company that the project is being created for

In previous versions of the CLI, this has been referred to as the domain, but it has been changed to area to avoid confusion with DNS domain.

| name | `{example_project_name}` | Name of the project to create in the working directory
