==== List the known components

The `component` command can be used to display the components that are known to the system. This is useful to be able to look at the internal configuration and be able to see where things are downloaded from as well as determine the desired configuration.

[source,bash]
----
stacks-cli component list
----

This will display the builtin configuration for the components, as shown below.

This command also respects the `--internalconfig` parameter that allows the internal configuration to be overridden. The override configuration is shown below:

.Override internal configuration file
[source,yaml]
----
stacks:
  components:
    infra_data:
      group: infra
      name: data
      package:
        url: https://github.com/amido/stacks-azure-data
        version: russellseymour/scaffold-test
        type: git
----

The command to use this file to list out the components, with the accompanying overrides is as follows.

[source,bash]
----
stacks-cli component list --internalconfig ..\..\local\override.yml
----
