==== .NET WebApi project using the interactive command

The interactive command is designed to ask questions on the command line about the configuration required for setting up Ensono Digital Stacks. It will then save this configuration out to a file that can be read in using the `scaffold` command.

[source,bash]

The values as specified in the previous configuration table have been used in the following screenshot of the interactive session.

The resulting configuration file contains all of the configuration that was used to generate the projects, which means it can be used to produce the same project stack again.
