== Runtime Configuration

Configuration for the CLI can be performed in several ways:

  - On the command line
  - Using environment variables
  - Using a configuration file (YAML or JSON)

When using a configuration file it is possible to setup more than one project.

=== Settings

The following tables show the configuration options that are available at the root level and the command level.

==== Global Options

The following options can be applied to any command within the Stacks CLI.

.Global Options
[options="header"]
|===
| Option | Environment Variable | Description | Default | Options 
| `-c`, `--config` | AMIDOSTACKS_CONFIG | Path to the configuration file to use | | 
| `-l`, `--loglevel` | AMIDOSTACKS_LOG_LEVEL | Level of logging to be used | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `fatal` 
| `-H`, `--onlinehelp` | AMIDOSTACKS_OPTIONS_ONLINEHELP | State if the command should open the webpage for the spcified command | `false` |
| `-f`, `--logformat` | AMIDOSTACKS_LOG_FORMAT | Output type of the logging | `text` | `text`, `json` 
| `--logcolur` | AMIDOSTACKS_LOG_COLOUR | State if logging should include colour | | 
| `--logfile` | AMIDOSTACKS_LOG_FILE | Write all logs to the specified file | | 
| `-w`, `--workingdirectory` | AMIDOSTACKS_DIRECTORY_WORKINGDIR | Directory that the projects should be created in | `${PWD}` | 
| `--tempdir` | AMIDOSTACKS_DIRECTORY_TEMPDIR | Directory to be used by Stacks for its temp files | System temp directory | 
| `--nobanner` | AMIDOSTACKS_OPTIONS_NOBANNER | Do not display the Stacks banner when running the command | `false` |
| `--nocliversion` | AMIDOSTACKS_OPTIONS_NOCLIVERSION | Do not perform a version check for the latest version of the Amido Stacks CLI | `false` |
| `--token` | AMIDOSTACKS_OPTIONS_TOKEN | The Stacks CLI can use the GitHub API to retrieve latest version infomration for the CLI as well as use it to ascertain Zip archive URLs without having to build up the URL to the asset manually.

By default the GitHub API rate limits unauthenticated API requests to 60 requests per hour, however authenticated requests can get 5,000 per hour.

The GitHub API will not be used if this value is not set.
|===

==== Completion Options

The CLI has a command called completion which can configure the local shell with tab based completion of commands.

.Completion Options
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
| Option | Description
| `bash` | Configure the Bash shell with auto-completion script
| `fish` | Configure the Fish shell with auto-completion
| `powershell` | Configure the PowerShell shell with auto-completion
| `zsh` | Configure the Zsh shell with auto-completion
|===

For each of the different shells, the command `stacks-cli <SHELL> -h` can be used which will show the command to be used to export the script into the profile for the shell.

.Loading completions into the shell for each new session
|===
| Shell | PowerShell | Linux | MacOS 
| `bash` | | `stacks-cli completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/stacks-cli` | `stacks-cli completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/stacks-cli`
| `fish` | 2+| `stacks-cli completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/stacks-cli.fish`
| `powershell` 3+| `stacks-cli completion powershell \| Out-String \| Invoke-Expression \| Out-File -FilePath $PROFILE -Append`
| `zsh` | | `stacks-cli completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_stacks-cli"` | `stacks-cli completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_stacks-cli` 
|===



==== Interactive Options

As the configuration file for the CLI can seem a bit daunting it has an interactive mode which will prompt for answers to questions about how projects are to be configured.

After the command has been run the resultant configuration file can be run with the `scaffold` command.

There are no additional options to be specified for the interactive command over and above the global options.

==== Scaffold Options

.Scaffold Options
[options="header"]
|===
| Option | Environment Variable | Description | Default | Options 
| `-n`, `--name` | AMIDOSTACKS_PROJECT_NAME | Name of the project to create | | 
| `--sourcecontrol` | AMIDOSTACKS_PROJECT_SOURCECONTROL_TYPE | Source control system to be used | `github` | 
| `-u`, `--sourcecontrolurl` | AMIDOSTACKS_PROJECT_SOURCECONTROL_URL | URL to the remote repository | | 
| `--projectsettingsfile` | AMIDOSTACKS_PROJECT_SETTINGSFILE | Each project will have its own `stackscli.yml` file, however this can ber overridden with a path to a different file using this option | `null` |

This can be a version, a tag, a SHA ref or a branch. | `latest` | 
| `--frameworkprops` | AMIDOSTACKS_PROJECT_FRAMEWORK_PROPERTIES 3+| Properties that need to be set to allow the scaffolding to run the correct command

The project settings file will be defined by the project maintainers, but will may specify that a property needs to be set.
| `-P`, `--platformtype` | AMIDOSTACKS_PLATFORM_TYPE | Platform being deployed to | | `aks` 
| `-p`, `--pipeline` | AMIDOSTACKS_PIPELINE | Pipeline being used to build the project | | `azdo`, `gha` 
| `-C`, `--cloud` | AMIDOSTACKS_CLOUD | Cloud platform being used | | `azure`, `aws`, `gcp`

| `--internaldomain` | AMIDOSTACKS_NETWORK_BASE_DOMAIN_INTERNAL | Internal domain root to be used for projects. | If not specified then the internal domain will be inferred from the external by replacing the TLD with `internal`. Thus if `mydomain.com` is provided as the external domain then the internal will be set to `mydomain.internal`. |
| `--cmdlog` | AMIDOSTACKS_OPTIONS_CMDLOG | Create a log file of all the commands that have been run during the scaffold process

The command log is create in the current directory with the filename `cmdlog.txt` | `false` |
| `--dryrun` | AMIDOSTACKS_OPTIONS_DRYRUN | Perform a dry run of the scaffold process. Useful for checking that things will be setup as required. No operations will be performed on the machine when run in this mode | `false` |
| `--settingsfile` | AMIDOSTACKS_SETTINGSFILE | Name of the file to look for in the project | `stackscli.yml` | 
| `--cmdlog` | AMIDOSTACKS_CMDLOG | Generate a log of all the commands that the CLI has run.

The `cmdlog.txt` file is created in the directory that the CLI has been run in. | `false` |
| `--dryrun` | AMIDOSTACKS_DRYRUN | Perform a dryrun of all the CLI. Particularly useful when used with `--cmdlog` | `false` |
| `--save` | AMIDOSTACKS_SAVE | If using the interactive or command line mode for configuring the CLI, the given configuration can be saved to a file. This allows the configuration to be replayed again at a later date.

The configuration is saved to `stacks.yml` in the specified working directory | `false` |
| `--nocleanup` | AMIDOSTACKS_NOCLEANUP | Do not perform cleanup operations after the scaffoling has been completed | `false` |
|`--force` | AMIDOSTACKS_FORCE | *This is a destructive operation*

By using `force` the CLI will delete any projects, of the same name, that already exist in the working directory and then create the new project in its place.

It will also continue to run if the command version checks fail. For example if the project calls for `dotnet` version 3.1 and you have 5.0.303, the CLI would not normally continue, but with `force` this will be ignored and the process will continue. | `false` | 
|===

==== Version Options

There are no additional options that can be specified for this command. It returns the current version of the Stacks CLI.

=== Command Log Format

If the command log has been enabled, using `--cmdlog`, a file with all the commands that have been run during the scaffolding operation will be generated. The format of this file is as follows:

`[<DIR>] <CMD> <ARGS>`

The <DIR> shows in which directory the command has been run in. Please note that this directory may have been deleted after the CLI has been run as it was temporary.

The <CMD> and <ARGS> show the command that was run and the arguments that were passed to it.

NOTE: On Windows based machines the <CMD> will be prefixed with `cmd /C` which tells the CLI how to run the command. PowerShell has not yet been used as it is easy to customise the shell and those customisations may cause the CLI to fail when running the commands.

=== Configuration File

The following shows an example of a configuration file that can be passed to the command.

----

Note that when using the configuration file it is possible to specify multiple projects to be configured. This allows several projects to be setup at the same time, without having to run the command multiple times. Each project will be created within the specified working directory.

If this file was called `conf.yml` the command to run to consume the file would be:

[source,bash]

.\stacks-cli.exe scaffold -c .\local\conf.yml
