=== Setup Options

The setup command, and subsequent sub commands, are used to configure the CLI. The application has the ability to read in multiple files from the directory tree and and merge them into the configuration for that run. This means that it is possible to set the company name globally, and then have specific settings for a project, such as the Terraform state location.

There are two sub commands for setup:
