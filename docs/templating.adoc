== Templating

Many parts of the CLI support templates, which means that files can be written out using the values that have been specified on the command line or in a configuration file. These templates are based on the Go template language and as such a number of items are passed to the template function when it is run.

There are two objects that are passed:

* Input Object - All of the configuration that was passed to the CLI on execution.
* Project - Contains all of the settings that are pertinent to the project currently being setup.

<<cli_configuration_file>> contains an example of the information that can be passed to the command.

In both cases accessing the values is done using the dot notation, so to get the value for the cloud platform the token `{{ .Input.Cloud.Platform }}` would be used. Similarly to get the working directory for the project this would be used `{{ .Project.Directory.WorkingDirectory }}` would be used.

The following table shows all of the tokens that can be used in a template string. Each token value should be surrounded by `{{ }}`.
