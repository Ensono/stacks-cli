== Using the CLI

The Ensono Stacks CLI is built using Go, which means that it is a single binary which can be downloaded and run without the need to run an installer. It is currently built for the following platforms

 - icon:windows[fw] Windows
 - icon:apple[fw] Mac OS
 - icon:linux[fw] Linux

The CLI will download the specified projects and run a series of operations to customise them according to the user's requirements. The steps that are to be performed in each project is governed by a project settings file, which by default is called `stackscli.yml`.
