==== Completion

The completion command adds completion scripts to any of the following shells:

 - bash
 - fish
 - powershell
 - zsh

By adding the completion to the shell, it allows the [TAB] key to be used to cycle through the options of any command, making discovery of options easier and increase efficiency.

The following command shows the help for configuring auto-completion for PowerShell.

[source,bash]
----
stacks-cli completion powershell -h
----
