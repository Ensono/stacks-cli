===== Export

The CLI relies on a number of internal configuration settings. This is not normally information that is required as the inputs to the command are sufficient to create the necessary projects.

However in certain situation it is useful to be able to see what this internal configuration is. The CLI has an `export` command that will write these files out to the filesystem so that they can be analysed.

[source,bash]
----
stacks-cli version --directory exported

NOTE: As with all commands the `--dryrun` option can be specified which will display what will be done but not actually perform the operation.

As can be seen from the screenshot the two files have been output to the `exported` directory in the current location.
