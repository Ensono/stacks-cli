==== Scaffold

The `scaffold` command is the main command that will be used. This downloads the specified projects, customises them and sets them up in the specified directory. To see the help for this command run the following:

[source,bash]
----
stacks-cli scaffold -h
----

The <<Examples>> section has a lot of examples showing how to run the Ensono Stacks CLI.

===== Overriding internal configuration

When new features are added to components or new components need to be tested, the CLI scaffold command accepts an override file using the `--internalconfig` argument.

Only specific parts of the configuration need to be overridden to satisfy the requirement; the while config does not need to be passed in.

The CLI has a number of components already configured. By using an override file with the appropriate configuration they can be modified. Take the following table as an example.

[cols="1a,1a",options="header"]
|====
| Internal Config (section) | Override Config
| 
[source,yml]
----
include::../../../internal/config/staticFiles/config.yml[lines=35..59]
----
|
[source,yml]
----
stacks:
  components:
    dotnet_webapi:
      group: dotnet
      name: webapi
      package:
        url: https://github.com/ensonodigital/stacks-dotnet-v2
        type: git

    infra_data:
      group: infra
      name: data
      package:
        url: https://github.com/ensonodigital/stacks-infra-data
        type: git
----
|====

With these two files the resultant packages that the CLI can use will be:

[source,yml,linenums]
----
stacks:
  components:
    dotnet_webapi:
      group: dotnet
      name: webapi
      package:
        url: https://github.com/ensonodigital/stacks-dotnet-v2
        type: git

    dotnet_cqrs:
      group: dotnet
      name: cqrs
      package:
        name: Amido.Stacks.CQRS.Templates
        type: nuget
        id: stacks-dotnet-cqrs

    java_webapi:
      group: java
      name: webapi
      package:
        url: https://github.com/Ensono/stacks-java
        version: master
        type: git

    infra_data:
      group: infra
      name: data
      package:
        name: https://github.com/ensonodigital/stacks-infra-data
        type: git        
----

As can be seen the `dotnet_webapi` compnent ULR, on line 7, has been updated to reflect the new URL as well as change the type of package.

Lines 26 - 31 show the new component that has been added with the override configuration.
