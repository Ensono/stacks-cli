==== Setup

The `setup` command can be used to set values to be used as defaults when running other commands. This is to help reduce the amount of times repetitive values need to be manually entered.

Such values are the `company` name, which can be set globally, and then the `project` name which can be set per project folder. To achieve this the command will write portions of the configuration file out to different locations. These locations are then read in when the command is run to pull in and merge the configuration.

There are a couple of sub commands for `setup`:

* <<Update>> - Adds or updates values in the file
* <<List>> - Lists the files that would be read in from the current directory

===== Update

The following command sets the `company` name globally:

[source,powershell]
----
stackscli setup update -g --company ensono
----

.Updating the globals settings file

It is possible to set any of the values as a global value, however it is not recommended. The following example shows what happens when the project name is set as a global value.

[source,powershell]
----
stackscli setup update -g --company ensono --project website
----

.Updating the globals settings file with project value

Setting values in a project file is just a case of moving into the directory in which the file should be created or set the working directory value. The following two commands achieve the same result.

[cols="1a,1a"]
|====
|
[source,powershell]
|---
cd workspaces/projects/myproject
stackscli setup update --project website
|---
|
[source,powershell]
|---
stackscli setup update --project website -w workspaces/projects/myproject
|---
|====

The result will be a file in a the directory `workspaces/projects/.stackscli/config.yml`.

===== List

Sometimes it can be hard to determine which files are going to be sourced when the tool is executed. To help with this the `list` command will show the files that would be sourced from that directory upwards.

[source,powershell]
----
stackscli setup list
----

.List out the configuration files
