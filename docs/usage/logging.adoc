=== Logging

The Ensono Digital Stacks CLI is designed to be as simple and efficient to use as possible, however there are cases when it is useful to gewt more information from the CLI when it is being run.

Bu default the CLI runs with `info` level logging, which means that simple messages about what is happening are displayed. If an error occurs within the CLI itself then this will be displayed, however when the CLI runs an external command, as is the case when it runs configuration from a project, and it fails you may see messages similar to the following:

.Errors from the operations that the CLI runs

This is not terribly helpful to understand what is happening. This is ocurring because the CLI is running other commands that are outputting to `stderr` which the CLI does not show by default. To change this behaviour change the logging to `debug` or `trace` and the output will no include all of the commands that are being run as well any output on `stdout`.
