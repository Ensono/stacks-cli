=== Validation

The CLI will validate certain inputs to make sure that they are valid for use with the scaffolding commands as defined by the project settings.

In some cases the CLI will modify the inputs, for example if a space is present in the company name it will be replaced with an underscore:

 - "My Company" icon:arrow-right[fw] "My_Company"
 - "My Fantastic Company" icon:arrow-right[fw] "My_Fantastic_Company"
 - "My  Company" icon:arrow-right[fw] "My_Company"
